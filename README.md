# Data-Preparation-for-Machine-Learning-In-Python-Part-3-Train-Test-Split
#### As you know, it is important that we test our models thoroughly on new data that they haven't seen before. 
#### This entails splitting our dataset into two: training set wich should be at least 70% of our data and the testing set
#### It is therefore important that our model building decisions and in particular feature engineering decisions are made based on what we see in our training data.
#### We can then test the effectiveness of these techinques and our model on the testing dataset.
